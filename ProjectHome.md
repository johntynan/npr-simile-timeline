# The NPR SIMILE Timeline #

## Introduction ##

The [NPR SIMILE Timeline](http://npr-simile-timeline.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/newsample.html) (Beta) allows you to display a listing of NPR stories on a timeline.  This timeline, made entirely of open source technologies,  connects the [NPR API](http://api.npr.org) to MIT's [Simile Timeline](http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/) javascript application.  In addition to using this to display a timeline in your blog, to link to a timeline, or to send a timeline in email, you are welcome to become involved by [suggesting enhancements](http://code.google.com/p/npr-simile-timeline/issues/list) to this application  or to [repurpose the code entirely](http://code.google.com/p/npr-simile-timeline/source/checkout) in your own applications.

## Details ##

  * View the [NPR SIMILE Timeline](http://npr-simile-timeline.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/newsample.html) (Note: this script also allows you to create the necessary code to put a timeline on your site)

  * View a [presentation](http://johntynan.com/presentations/nprtimeline/01/) about how the timeline works.

This script owes an incredible amount to the NPR Digital Media team. You can find out more about the NPR API [here](http://api.npr.org/). You can also read about what they're up to on their blog [Inside NPR](http://npr.org/blogs/inside).

This project equally owes a great amount to the [Simile Timeline](http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/) project. You can read the documentation [here](http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Timeline), or ask a question about the timeline widget [here](http://groups.google.com/group/simile-widgets).
