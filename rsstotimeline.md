# RSS to Timeline #

Dale Hobson has "been thinking more about the timeline widget and possible uses beyond the API. So many sites can output RSS that a version of this that could use any selected RSS feed URL instead of an NPR API query output in JSON could be widely useful. For example, I can create an RSS feed of any content in NCPR's news db using a keyword switch. Point to the correct feed and I could timeline out coverage of any issue/story/person from my own sources.

And if you could aggregate from an array of feed URLs, that could truly kick ass."
